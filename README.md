How to Deploy This Salesforce Project to Your Org
Follow these steps to deploy the Salesforce project files from this repository into your own Salesforce org.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Salesforce CLI (sf or sfdx): Download and install the Salesforce CLI from Salesforce CLI Downloads.
Git: Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository. You can download it from Git Downloads.
A Salesforce Developer Org or a Sandbox: You need a Salesforce org where you have appropriate permissions to deploy metadata.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Replace yourusername and your-repo-name with the appropriate GitHub username and repository name.

Navigate into the cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Step 2: Authenticate to Salesforce
You need to authenticate the Salesforce CLI with your Salesforce org:

Run the following command to log in to your Salesforce org:

bash
Copy code
sf login org
This command will open a browser window for you to log in to your Salesforce org.

Select the appropriate Salesforce environment (Production, Sandbox, or Developer Edition) during login.

Step 3: Deploy the Metadata to Your Org
Once authenticated, you can deploy the project files to your Salesforce org:

Run the following command to deploy the metadata:

bash
Copy code
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app
This command will deploy all metadata in the force-app directory to your authenticated Salesforce org.

Wait for the deployment to complete. The CLI will display the deployment status and any errors or warnings that occur.

Step 4: Verify the Deployment
After the deployment is complete, verify that everything is working correctly:

Log in to your Salesforce org.
Navigate to Setup to check that the custom fields, triggers, classes, and other components have been deployed successfully.
Test the functionality to ensure everything is working as expected.
