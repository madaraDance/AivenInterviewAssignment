# Salesforce Project Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Salesforce project files from this repository to your own Salesforce org.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Salesforce CLI (`sf` or `sfdx`)**: [Download and install the Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli).
- **Git**: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **A Salesforce Developer Org or Sandbox**: Ensure you have an appropriate Salesforce org to deploy the metadata.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. **Open your terminal.**
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you want to clone the repository.
3. **Run the following command** to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madaraDance/AivenInterviewAssignment.git
   ```

4. **Navigate into the cloned repository**:

   ```

## Step 2: Authenticate to Salesforce

1. **Run the following command** to log in to your Salesforce org:
